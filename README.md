# Premialab_dashboard

This dashboard is a collaborative project by DU Qinglin, HE Qingwen, LI Jiaxi, Li Zilin, ZHANG Boxi, and ZHANG Menghan. It allows users to freely combine different assets as needed, calculate various factor exposures of the portfolio, and perform backtesting of the portfolio. Additionally, it is equipped with multiple benchmarks for comparison.

## Features

- **Flexible Asset Combination**: Combine different assets to create a custom portfolio.
- **Factor Exposure Calculation**: Calculate various factor exposures of the portfolio.
- **Backtesting**: Perform backtesting to evaluate the portfolio's performance over time.
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare the portfolio against multiple benchmarks.

## Installation

To use this dashboard, you need to download all files from the directory to a local folder and run the `7035final.ipynb` file. This file is a Python notebook and requires Python 3.

### Steps
